# Change log

Expect active development and potentially significant breaking changes in the `0.x` track. We'll try to be diligent about releasing a `1.0` version in a timely fashion (ideally within 1 or 2 months), so that we can take advantage of SemVer to signify breaking changes from that point on.

### vNEXT

- ...


### v0.3.4

### v0.3.3

- Removed vestigial code that partially implemented refetching via the Relay Node interface, but was not possible to use through the public API.

### v0.3.1

- Made client more robust in the case where the server returns an empty error array, even though that's not in the GraphQL spec. [Issue #156](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client/issues/155) [PR #173](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client/pull/173)

### v0.3.0

- **Breaking change:** Require all queries to be wrapped with a `gql` template literal tag, and throw an error when they aren't. [Issue #155](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client/issues/155) [PR #168](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client/pull/168)
- Remove all dependencies on the `graphql` parser module at runtime, except for the `gql` template literal tag, so that queries can be pre-parsed in production to save on parsing overhead.

- Move importable modules to root. [PR #169](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client/pull/169)
